DEFAULT MAP TILE is no tile. on the sky, there is nothing but empty space. on the ground, it is grass. underground, it is dirt. the tile BECOMES something
     when we update it on the server, either through a client chat update command, or using a tool to dig. If we dig, the tile becomes a a dug out square 
    (if we are underground that is. on the surface, digging would produce a hole that drops down, into the ground.) This would allow for less to be 
    sent to the clients.


need to make a logout method for when closing the sockets to remove players from onlineAccounts that updates their information on accounts map.

need to create a few new tiles and work on map update commands.
