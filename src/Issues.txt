SERIALIZE SERVER AND CLIENT
    server will now send Packet.class object's. will be standardized for easier client reading. will contain an static int for type of packet,
    whether chat or movement, then will contain the rest of the data however it needs to be represented. a map, will be a 2d array that just gets
    copied over the clients 2d array whenever an update happens.

DEFAULT MAP TILE is no tile. on the sky, there is nothing but empty space. on the ground, it is grass. underground, it is dirt. the tile BECOMES something
     when we update it on the server, either through a client chat update command, or using a tool to dig. If we dig, the tile becomes a a dug out square 
    (if we are underground that is. on the surface, digging would produce a hole that drops down, into the ground.) This would allow for less to be 
    sent to the clients.
