Things I think the game needs to be functionally complete and abstract development can begin (quests/monster ai).

Client
    Map
        *-Local Coordinates
        *-Draw screen moving with player in center
        *-Draw the map based on what the server sends it as it moves. an array would work well for this. lots of shifting data around.
    Options Pane
        *-Needs actual changeable options
        *-Needs to be saved on exit.
    Inventory Pane
        *-Draw the squares for the inventory
        *-Make the inventory resize-able based on the backpack capacity
    Tile-Generator
        *-Still need to design different tiles... this is lowest priority

Server
    Server-Client Communication
        *-On login, need to send information of everyone and everything around people logging in, to the person that logged in.
        *-On read, for movement and map update, query online list to see if anyone in range and if so, write to their sendback[] and flag for write.
    Accounts
        *-Finish basic account creation
        *-Accounts need to save either on creation, or exit.
    Map
        *-Server sends proper map tiles based on player movement
        *-Map updates from client commands
        *-Changes need to save, either on creation, or exit.
        *-Map file needs to be created to contain just tile information.
