Things I think the game needs to be functionally complete and abstract development can begin (quests/monster ai).

Client
    Monsters
        *-Need to remove creatures from memory when they are no longer in range.
    Accounts
        *-Finish account creation including customizable characters
    Map
        *-Client needs to know what it can and cannot walk on. Server should verify, but client should know.
    Options Pane
        *-Needs actual changeable options
        *-Needs to be saved on exit.
    Inventory Pane
        *-Draw the squares for the inventory
        *-Make the inventory resize-able based on the backpack capacity
    Tile-Generator
        *-Still need to design different tiles... this is lowest priority

Server
    Accounts
        *-Finish basic account creation
    Map
        *-Server needs to send map information for 3 floors below the client. This should allow for looking down mountains.
        *-Map updates from client commands and after updating, notify's all in range of new tile.
    Items
        *-When an item is placed/dropped, a new map tile needs to be made. Unfortunate, but unavoidable with the current system. System might need a redesign.
