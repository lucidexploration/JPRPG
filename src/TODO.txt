Things I think the game needs to be functionally complete and abstract development can begin (quests/monster ai).

Client
    Map
        *-Local Coordinates
        *-Draw player moving around
        *-Draw screen moving with player in center
        *-Draw the map based on what the server sends it as it moves. an array would work well for this. lots of shifting data around.
    Options Pane
        *-Needs actual changeable options
        *-Needs to be saved on exit.
    Inventory Pane
        *-Draw the squares for the inventory
        *-Make the inventory resize-able based on the backpack capacity
    Tile-Generator
        *-Still need to design different tiles... this is lowest priority

Server
    Server-Client Communication
        *-On read, check if anything has been written to sendback array at end of loop, even if not by client being read. If so, break, and flag for write.
        *-On read, for movement and map update, query online list to see if anyone in range and if so, write to their sendback[]
        *-Add sendBack[] write to server write. Checks account.sendback[] to see if any of their lengths are >0. If so, write. Then clear the array.
    Accounts
        *-Finish basic account creation
        *-Accounts need to save either on creation, or exit.
        *-Track who is online in a separate map from the accounts map for quicker queuing of sendback[] messages
    Map
        *-Server sends proper map tiles based on player movement
        *-Map updates from client commands
        *-Changes need to save, either on creation, or exit.
        *-Map file needs to be created to contain just tile information.
    Chat
        *-Needs to write to sendback[] of everyone online
